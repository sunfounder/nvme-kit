Dual NVMe Kit
===============================================

The **Dual NVMe Kit** enables you to connect two M.2 peripheral devices (such as NVMe drives and other PCIe accessories) to the Raspberry Pi 5's PCIe interface.

The Dual NVMe Kit integrates a PCIe Gen 2 switch with two M.2 M-key PCIe slots supporting 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280 sizes, allowing the installation of two NVMe Gen2 SSDs or AI accelerators.  
Users can configure two NVMe SSDs in software RAID 0 or RAID 1 for NAS setups, combine one AI accelerator with one NVMe SSD to enhance AI performance, or install two AI accelerators for even more powerful AI capabilities.

**Features**

- Dual-channel PCIe 2.0 interface (peak transfer rate up to 500 MB/s)
- Supports devices using the M.2 M-key connector
- Supports (PCIe Gen 2.0) NVMe M.2 SSD sizes: 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280
- Provides up to 3A of current for connected M.2 devices
- 2-pin 2.54mm header and cable for additional external power supply
- Mounts to the back of the Raspberry Pi, without interfering with the use of the active cooler or other compatible Raspberry Pi expansion boards
- Connects to the Raspberry Pi via an FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) cable

NVMe Kit
===============================================

The **NVMe Kit** allows you to connect an M.2 NVMe SSD to the Raspberry Pi 5's PCIe interface.

The NVMe Kit integrates a PCIe Gen 2 switch with an M.2 M-key PCIe slot supporting 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280 sizes, allowing the installation of NVMe Gen2 SSDs or AI accelerators.

This compact module is only slightly larger than the SSD itself. It can be mounted either on top of or beside the Raspberry Pi, occupying minimal space and remaining compatible with the installation of the active cooler.

**Features**

- Single-channel PCIe 2.0 interface (peak transfer rate up to 500 MB/s)
- Supports devices using the M.2 M-key connector
- Supports (PCIe Gen 2.0) NVMe M.2 SSD sizes: 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280
- Provides up to 3A of current for connected M.2 devices
- Can be mounted either on top of or beside the Raspberry Pi, compatible with the active cooler
- Includes two customized FPC cables for different mounting configurations
