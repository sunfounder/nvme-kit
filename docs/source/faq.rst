FAQ
================

**Q1: How do I know if I have the Dual NVMe Kit or the NVMe Kit?**  

**A1:** The **Dual NVMe Kit** supports dual device installation, while the **NVMe Kit** supports only a single device installation.


---------------------------------------------

**Q2: Does the Dual NVMe Kit require driver installation?**  

**A2:** No additional drivers are needed. Raspberry Pi OS and most mainstream Linux systems natively support PCIe NVMe devices.


---------------------------------------------

**Q3: Does the NVMe Kit support PCIe Gen3 or higher devices?**  

**A3:** The NVMe Kit is designed based on PCIe 2.0. Even if you install PCIe Gen3 or higher devices, they will operate at PCIe 2.0 speeds.


---------------------------------------------

**Q4: For the Dual NVMe Kit, can I install only one NVMe SSD?**  

**A4:** Yes. The Dual NVMe Kit can operate normally even with only one NVMe SSD installed; installing two devices is not required.


---------------------------------------------

**Q5: Does the NVMe Kit support hot swapping?**  

**A5:** No. The PCIe interface does not support hot swapping. Please power off the Raspberry Pi before inserting or removing M.2 devices.


---------------------------------------------

**Q6: Is the FPC cable length limited? Can I replace it with a longer one?**  

**A6:** The included FPC cable length is optimized for signal integrity. It is not recommended to replace it with a longer or different cable, as this may cause unstable communication.


---------------------------------------------

**Q7: Will connecting the Dual NVMe Kit reduce the performance of the Raspberry Pi?**  

**A7:** Generally, no. However, please note that the Raspberry Pi 5 has limited PCIe lane resources, and the available bandwidth is shared among connected devices. Performance may be slightly affected during heavy simultaneous data transfers.
